Backups


Best way to create backups of VM's?
Postby omega1 » 12. Mar 2014, 13:28

Hi all,

I would like some input / suggestions on the best way to
accomplish this:

I run a number of VM's on my Windows host and would like
to be able to create copies for the purpose of backing up
should I lose my data on the host machine (and therefore
all my VM's).

i would like to create periodic backups (daily/weekly)
and store them at a remote location should I lose my data
on the host machine.

- Should I use snapshot, clone or just copy the .vdi file?
  When I do this, does it have to be shut down?
- Can I automate this procedure? If yes, how?
- Any other items I should consider to make this happen?

Thanks in advance for comments, advice, etc...

Snapshots have nothing to do with making backups, so
you should disregard that idea.  Nor should you copy 
only the VDI files: disks can't run themselves, you
need to back up the entire virtual PC.

The best way to make a backup is to shut down (not
suspend) the VM, then copy the entire VM folder, with
contents, to secondary storage.

VMs can also be backed up from the inside, using the
same tools that you might run on a physical PC.
This can be more complicated to do however.

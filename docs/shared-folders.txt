Shared Folders

These provide an easy way to exchange files between the host and the guest.
Much like ordinary Windows network shares, you can tell VirtualBox to treat
a certain host directory as a shared folder, and VirtualBox will make it
available to the guest operating system as a network share, irrespective of
whether guest actually has a network.

=============================
o Configured /media/covellite, which has previously been mounted to 
/dev/sdb1, for shared linux directory in windows machine:

1. In open windows machine window open Share Folders:
Devices > Shared Folders Settings...

2. This opens up a rmarcil1 - Settings window with:

Shared Folders
  Machine Folders
  Transient Folders

"transient VM shares, which can be added and removed at runtime and do not
persist after a VM has stopped"

UserManual.pdf, 4.3 Shared folders, p. 71

3. Click the "+" folder icon, in the upper right, to create a new
Machine Folder.

4. Add Add Share popup select linux folder to access:

Folder Path: /media/covellite
Folder Name: covellite
<unchecked> Read-only
          x Auto-mount
          x Make Permanent

click OK

5. The 00TARBALLS share is now available under
START > Computer > Network > VBOXSVR > \\VBOXSVR\covellite

6. covellite can be mapped as a network drive with:
START > right-click Computer > Map network drive...

Drive:    Y:                      <=== Or whatever is desired
Folder:   \\VBOXSVR\covellite   <=== Can click browse and select.
                                       Granted in mixed case.

           x Reconnect at login
 <unchecked> Connect using different credentials

click Finish

7. Will now get covellite (\\VBOXSVR)(Y:) under computer.

8. Create a symlink to /usr/local/src/00TARBALLS/ for easy access
to home network share.  Performed some test create/copies.  Worked just fine.

9. Created shortcut on desktop to covellite (\\VBOXSVR)(Y:)

Yeh hah!   Got this knocked.

Restarted rmarcil1 machine to verify functionality.



4.3. Shared folders
===================
With the "shared folders" feature of VirtualBox, you can access files of your
host system from within the guest system.  This is similar how you would use
network shares in Windows networks -- except that shared folders do not need
require networking, only the Guest Additions.  Shared Folders are supported
with Windows (2000 or newer), Linux and Solaris guests.

Shared folders must physically reside on the host and are then shared with the
guest, which uses a special file system driver in the Guest Addition to talk
to the host.  For Windows guests, shared folders are implemented as a
pseudo-network redirector; for Linux and Solaris guests, the Guest Additions
provide a virtual file system.

To share a host folder with a virtual machine in VirtualBox, you must specify
the path of that folder and choose for it a "share name" that the guest can
use to access it.  Hence, first create the shared folder on the host; then,
within the guest, connect to it.

There are several ways in which shared folders can be set up for a particular
virtual machine:

o In the window of a running VM, you can select "Shared folders" from the
  "Devices" menu, or click on the folder icon on the status bar in the bottom
  right corner.

o If a VM is not currently running, you can configure shared folders in each
  virtual machine's "Settings" dialog.

o From the command line, you can create shared folders using VBoxManage, as
  follows:

  VBoxManage sharedfolder add "VM name" --name "sharename" --hostpath "C:\test"

  See Section 8.29, "VBoxManage sharedfolder add/remove" for details.
  [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-sharedfolder]

There are two types of shares:

1. VM shares which are only available to the VM for which they have been
   defined;

2. transient VM shares, which can be added and removed at runtime and do not
   persist after a VM has stopped; for these, add the --transient option to
   the above command line.

Shared folders have read/write access to the files at the host path by default.
To restrict the guest to have read-only access, create a read-only shared
folder.  This can either be achieved using the GUI or by appending the
parameter --readonly when creating the shared folder with VBoxManage.

Starting with version 4.0, VirtualBox shared folders also support symbolic
links (symlinks), under the following conditions:

1. The host operating system must support symlinks (i.e. a Mac, Linux or
    Solaris host is required).

2. Currently only Linux and Solaris Guest Additions support symlinks.

4.3.1. Manual mounting
----------------------
You can mount the shared folder from inside a VM the same way as you would
mount an ordinary network share:

o In a Windows guest, shared folders are browseable and therefore visible in
  Windows Explorer.  So, to attach the host's shared folder to your Windows
  guest, open Windows Explorer and look for it under
  "My Networking Places" -> "Entire Network" -> "VirtualBox Shared Folders".
  By right-clicking on a shared folder and selecting "Map network drive" from
  the menu that pops up, you can assign a drive letter to that shared folder.

  Alternatively, on the Windows command line, use the following:

  net use x: \\vboxsvr\sharename

  While vboxsvr is a fixed name (note that vboxsrv would also work), replace
  "x:" with the drive letter that you want to use for the share, and sharename
  with the share name specified with VBoxManage.

o In a Linux guest, use the following command:

  mount -t vboxsf [-o OPTIONS] sharename mountpoint

  To mount a shared folder during boot, add the following entry to /etc/fstab:

  sharename   mountpoint   vboxsf   defaults  0   0

o In a Solaris guest, use the following command:

  mount -F vboxfs [-o OPTIONS] sharename mountpoint

  Replace sharename (use lowercase) with the share name specified with
  VBoxManage or the GUI, and mountpoint with the path where you want the share
  to be mounted on the guest (e.g. /mnt/share).  The usual mount rules apply,
  that is, create this directory first if it does not exist yet.

  Here is an example of mounting the shared folder for the user "jack" on
  Solaris:

  $ id
  uid=5000(jack) gid=1(other)
  $ mkdir /export/home/jack/mount
  $ pfexec mount -F vboxfs -o uid=5000,gid=1 jackshare /export/home/jack/mount
  $ cd ~/mount
  $ ls
  sharedfile1.mp3 sharedfile2.txt
  $

  Beyond the standard options supplied by the mount command, the following are
  available:

  iocharset CHARSET

  to set the character set used for I/O operations. Note that on Linux guests,
  if the "iocharset" option is not specified then the Guest Additions driver
  will attempt to use the character set specified by the CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT
  kernel option.  If this option is not set either then UTF-8 will be used.
  Also,

  convertcp CHARSET

  is available in order to specify the character set used for the shared
  folder name (utf8 by default).

  The generic mount options (documented in the mount manual page) apply also.
  Especially useful are the options uid, gid and mode, as they allow access by
  normal users (in read/write mode, depending on the settings) even if root
  has mounted the filesystem.


4.3.2. Automatic mounting
-------------------------
Starting with version 4.0, VirtualBox can mount shared folders automatically,
at your option.  If automatic mounting is enabled for a specific shared folder,
the Guest Additions will automatically mount that folder as soon as a user
logs into the guest OS. The details depend on the guest OS type:

o With Windows guests, any auto-mounted shared folder will receive its own
  drive letter (e.g. E:) depending on the free drive letters remaining in the
  guest.

  If there no free drive letters left, auto-mounting will fail; as a result,
  the number of auto-mounted shared folders is typically limited to 22 or less
  with Windows guests.

o With Linux guests, auto-mounted shared folders are mounted into the /media
  directory, along with the prefix sf_. For example, the shared folder myfiles
  would be mounted to /media/sf_myfiles on Linux and /mnt/sf_myfiles on Solaris.

  The guest property /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountPrefix determines
  the prefix that is used.  Change that guest operty to a value other than
  "sf" to change that prefix; see Section 4.6, "Guest properties" for details.
  [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-guestprops]

  Note
  Access to auto-mounted shared folders is only granted to the user group
  vboxsf, which is created by the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer.  Hence
  guest users have to be member of that group to have read/write access or to
  have read-only access in case the folder is not mapped writable.

To change the mount directory to something other than /media, you can set the
guest property /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir.

o Solaris guests behave like Linux guests except that /mnt is used as the
  default mount directory instead of /media.

To have any changes to auto-mounted shared folders applied while a VM is
running, the guest OS needs to be rebooted.  (This applies only to
auto-mounted shared folders, not the ones which are mounted manually.)


Windows share
=============
The simplist method, not elegant, is to create a network share on the windows
machine. This is then mounted by the linux host:

On rmarcil1 windows machine C:\share shared as \\RMARCIL1\share
On covellite debian wheezy 7.3 host the \\RMARCIL1\share is mounted in 
/etc/fstab using:

//192.168.92.52/share   /media/share     cifs   \
credentials=/home/marcilr/.smbcredentials,uid=marcilr,gid=marcilr   0   0

NOTE: 192.168.92.52 is the rmarcil1 win 7 pro machine ip address.

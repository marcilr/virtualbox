Virtual box uses the right ctrl key as the host key to exit VMs.  Since the Happy Hacker Lite 2 
keyboard lacks a  right-ctrl key. 

There are two solutions:

o At the machine window use:
Machine > Insert Ctrl-Alt-Del

o Configure another key as the the right ctrl for Happy Hacker Lite 2 keyboard use.

In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager:
i. File > Perferences... > Input

ii. Click on Host Key: Right Ctrl then click the key to use as the new break focus key.
I used the right diamonda key (right Winkey).

Now displays:
  Host Key: Right WinKey

click OK

This maps ctrl-del to right diamond - fn -` (del)

Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 keyboard does not have a right ctrl key.  VirtualBox uses 
right-ctrl-del to send a ctrl-alt-del to a VM.  

How is this accomplished with no right-ctrl key?

VirtualBox lets you redefine the break focus key. I personally use the right-side 
Windows key (I never use it otherwise).

To sent ctrl-alt-del for login hit right ctrl-del.

The Happy Hacker Lite 2 keyboard lacks a right ctrl key.
There are two solutions:

o At the machine window use:
Machine > Insert Ctrl-Alt-Del

o Configure another key as the the right ctrl for Happy Hacker Lite 2 keyboard use.

In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager:
i. File > Perferences... > Input

ii. Click on Host Key: Right Ctrl then click the key to use as the new break focus key.
I used the right diamond key (right Winkey).

click OK

This maps ctrl-del to right diamond - fn -` (del)

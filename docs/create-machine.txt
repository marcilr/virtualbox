7. Hard Disk Storage Type
Select the type of virtual hard disk you want to create.
A dynamically expanding storage initially occupies a very small 
amount of space on your physical hard disk. It will grow dynamically 
(up to the size specified) as the Guest OS claims disk space.

A fixed-size storage does not grow. It is stored in a file of 
approximately the same size as the size of the virtual hard disk. 
The creation of a fixed-size storage may take a long time depending 
on the storage size and the write performance of your harddisk.

Working on creating lvm on bornite for virtual machines.

$HOME/.VirtualBox/               - VirtualBox global configuration data.[1]
$HOME/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml - VirtualBox global registry of machines virtual media.[1]

Doesn't look like anything directly configurable in $HOME/.VirtualBox/ Files reference
use of VBoxManage or the VirtualBox Manager GUI.


VBoxManage setproperty
======================
This command is used to change global settings which affect the entire VirtualBox installation.
Some of these correspond to the settings in the "Global settings" dialog in the graphical user
interface. The following properties are available:

machinefolder
  This specifies the default folder in which virtual machine definitions are kept; see the section
  called "Where VirtualBox stores its files"[1] for details.

vrdeauthlibrary
  This specifies which library to use when "external" authentication has been selected for a
   particular virtual machine; see the section called "RDP authentication"[2] for details.

websrvauthlibrary
  This specifies which library the web service uses to authenticate users.  For details about the
  VirtualBox web service, please refer to the separate VirtualBox SDK reference (see Chapter 11,
  VirtualBox programming interfaces).[3]

vrdelibrary
  This specifies which library implements the VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension.

hwvirtexenabled
  This selects whether or not hardware virtualization support is enabled by default.

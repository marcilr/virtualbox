Migrate VM from Linux to Windows


Shena had asked me to copy the FET (Future Energy Technologies) machine off home bornite 
server to a new Toshiba Cavio 3 USB 3.0 portable hard drive.


Migrated from Linux to Windows
==============================
From googling the strategy is to create a new machine under windows then attach the drives,
*.vdi files, from the linux machine.


1. Copied borite's ajoite-non-domain FET (Future Energy Technologies) machine, and associated
files, from bornite's /data/virtualbox/ to the Toshiba Cavio 3 USB 3.0 (backward USB 2.0
compatible) 1TB portable hard drive:

    UserManual.pdf
    virtualbox        <=== Checkout of 00VIRTUALIZATION/virtualbox repo
  etc
  README.txt
  virtualbox-4.1.20
  virtualbox-4.2.6
ajoite-non-domain
ajoite-non-domain-20130109-ORIG
README.txt

2. Installed virtualbox windows software on Shena's laptop.

Under debian 6.0.6 amd64 the virtualbox version, that the ajoite-non-domain VM was created
under, was 4.1.20-80170:

$ dpkg -l | grep virtualbox
ii  virtualbox-4.1     4.1.20-80170~Debian~squeeze     Oracle VM VirtualBox

Downloaded the same virtualbox version for x86/amd64 with matching extension pack:
  VirtualBox-4.1.20-80170-Win.exe
  Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.20-80170.vbox-extpack

Installed VirtualBox-4.1.20-80170-Win.exe (91MB) on windows 7 home premium sp1 laptop
under C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox.  Opted for C:\ drive rather than the Toshiba
1TB as the USB 3.0 (USB 2.0 on laptop) is a very slow interface.

3. Under F:\virtualbox/00TARBALLS/virtualbox-4.1.20/ double-clicked:
  Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.20-80170.vbox-extpack

to install virtualbox extensions.

4. I was able to successfully open the ajoite-non-domain VM under VirtualBox 4.1.20-80170
then VirtualBox 4.2.6-82870.  Did have to reduce machines memory from 2048MB to 1024MB and
a few repairs for windows to adapt to new cpu and usb chipset.  Pretty smooth sailing.

Trying to attach the copied *.vdi drives to a new machine failed.  Would not boot.

Clone and move virtual machines in VirtualBox
Jack Wallen describes cloning and moving virtual machines in VirtualBox.
He tested this process going from Linux to Linux, Linux to Windows, and Windows to Linux hosts.
Step 4: Create a new virtual machine
The process of creating the new virtual machine will be the same as if you were creating a
standard virtual machine until you get to the Virtual Hard Disk creation screen (Figure C).
You will select Use Existing Hard Disk, click the folder icon, navigate to the newly copied
.vdi file, select the file in question, and then click Next.
Once the new virtual machine is created, that virtual machine should fire up as expected and
regardless of platform (I have tested this going from Linux to Linux, Linux to Windows, and
Windows to Linux hosts).

All I do is create new VM, but instead of creating a new hard disk, I copy the hard disk image
from the other machine to the new machine and add it.  Make sure you set it with the same
configuration as the first machine, and you're good to go.

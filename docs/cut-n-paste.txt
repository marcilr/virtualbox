2. Install Oracle VM VirtualBox Additions in windows machine:
   click Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image...
   double-click D:\VirtualBox Guest Additions

50-vmmouse.conf
===============
From googling found reference to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-vmmouse.conf
to enable this:

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier      "vmmouse"
        MatchIsPointer  "on"
        MatchTag        "vmmouse"
        Driver          "vmmouse"
EndSection

virtualbox.org/

The 50-vmmouse.conf file does look a bit old:
  covellite:/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d$ ls -l 50-vmmouse.conf 
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 115 Jun 14  2012 50-vmmouse.conf
  covellite:/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d$

Also no vmmouse drive running:
  covellite:~$ lsmod | grep vmmouse
  covellite:~$

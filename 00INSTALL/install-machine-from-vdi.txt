============================
o To install:
  LibreOffice
  Aterm

o Update from GNOME to XFCE:

1. Uninstall GNOME:
  aptitude purge `dpkg --get-selections | grep gnome | cut -f 1`
  aptitude -f install
  aptitude purge `dpkg --get-selections | grep deinstall | cut -f 1`
  aptitude -f install

Install XFCE:
  apt-get install xfce4

Install useful utilities:
  apt-get install xfce4-goodies

The above issue could indicate some Xfce dependencies are missing.
One solution to this is to install "task-xfce-desktop"
  sudo apt-get install task-xfce-deskto


Install Xfce in an already installed system

Importing a VDI in VirtualBox
=============================
MISCELLANEOUS | November 5, 2009

If you're used to be a VMware user and try to switch to the Open-Source
side of the Force by using VirtualBox, you may run into difficulties if
you try to import an existing  VDI file into VirtualBox.  Actually it's
quite easy, if you know how.

The main difference between VMware and VirtualBox is that VMware
captures a whole virtual machine in an image, whereas VirtualBox only
supports images of a hard disk.  So in VirtualBox's world, you first
need to create a new virtual machine, before using an existing
VirtualBox image.


1. First copy your VDI file into VirtualBox's virtual hard disks
   repository.  On Mac OS X it's 
     $HOME/Library/VirtualBox/HardDisks/.

   For windows os:
     C:\Users\[username]\VirtualBox VMs

2. Start VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine.

3. When you're asked for a hard disk image, select Use existing hard
   disk and click on the small icon on the right.

4. Which will brings you to the Virtual Media Manager.
   Click on Add and select the VDI file from step 1.

   Bound debian_6.0.6.vdi to new Debian 9 machine
   Renamed initial Debian 6.0.6 machine to:
     Debian-6.0.6-ORIG-20190110

   In windows 10 home directory this created:
     ~/VirtualBox VMS/Debian-6.0.6-ORIG-20190110/

   Yes, need to update from Debian 6.0.6 to 9.

5. After leaving the Virtual Media Manager, you'll be back in your
   virtual machine wizard. Now you can select your new VDI as existing
   hard disk and finalize the creation process.

6. Back in the main window, you're now able to start your new virtual machine.
   It's quite easy, if you know how.

Where is VirtualBox's virtual hard disks repository?
Which typically expands out to
  C:\Users\[username]\VirtualBox VMs
If you've decided to do a little more orgainization, the Machine Name
subfolders will be under the Machine Group subfolder. Full implementation
may look like the following:
  C:\Users\[username]\VirtualBox VMs\[vm group]\[vm name]

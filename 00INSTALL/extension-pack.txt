Installing VirtualBox and extension packs

VirtualBox comes in many different packages, and installation depends on your
host operating system.  If you have installed software before, installation
should be straightforward: on each host platform, VirtualBox uses the
installation method that is most common and easy to use. If you run into
trouble or have special requirements, please refer to Chapter 2, Installation
details[1] for details about the various installation methods.

Starting with version 4.0, VirtualBox is split into several components.
1. The base package consists of all open-source components and is licensed
   under the GNU General Public License V2.

2. Additional extension packs can be downloaded which extend the functionality
   of the VirtualBox base package.  Currently, Oracle provides the one
   extension pack, which can be found at
   http://www.virtualbox.org[2] and provides the following added functionality:

   a. The virtual USB 2.0 (EHCI) device; see the section called "USB
      settings".[3]  
   b. VirtualBox Remote Desktop Protocol (VRDP) support; see the section called
      "Remote display (VRDP support).[4]
   c. Intel PXE boot ROM with support for the E1000 network card.
   d. Experimental support for PCI passthrough on Linux hosts; see the section
      called "PCI passthrough".[5]

VirtualBox extension packages have a .vbox-extpack file name extension.  To
install an extension, simply double-click on the package file, and the
VirtualBox Manager will guide you through the required steps.

To view the extension packs that are currently installed, please start the
VirtualBox Manager (see the next section).  From the "File" menu, please
select "Preferences".  In the window that shows up, go to the "Extensions"
category which shows you the extensions which are currently installed and
allows you to remove a package or add a new one.

Alternatively you can use VBoxManage on the command line: see the section
called "VBoxManage extpack" [6] for details.



Installation
============
Under Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager version 4.1.8 r75467 installed the
Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.8-75467.vbox-extpack for use of USB 2.0
for the Microsoft livecam being used in the ajoite windows 7 x64 machine.

Installation was a bit tricky as root was required.  Had to install via
the command line using:

# VirtualBox  Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.8-75467.vbox-extpack 

This lanched the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager (as superuser) and I was
able to accept the license and run the Extension Pack installer.

Ultimately:

  The extension pack
  Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack 
  was installed successfully.


Install Extension Pack from cli
===============================
You can install the Extension Pack from the command line using VBoxManage.

VBoxManage extpack install <tarball> |
  uninstall [--force] <name> |
  cleanup

Example (UAA ITS Debian squeeze 6.04 amd64 boothite):
# vboxmanage extpack install Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.10-76795.vbox-extpack
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Successfully installed "Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack".

Sweet!

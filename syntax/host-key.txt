The HHK2 (Happy Hacker 2 keyboard) does not have a right ctrl key.  Hence
having the host key set to the right ctrl key does not work.

The virtualbox Globel Settings documentation describes how to change the
host key to any desired key.

On the GCI Network Services, OSS debian wheezy workstation I updated the
rmarcil win 7 pro hostkey from right ctrl to right winkey. (Wed Geb 11, 2015)
Very nice.


Globel Settings
===============
The global settings dialog can be reached through the File menu (under Oracle
VM VirtualBox Manager 4.3.36_Debian r105129), selecting:
  File > Preferences... (ctrl+g) > Input (2nd item)

It offers a selection of settings which apply to all virtual machines of the
current user or in the case of Extensions to the entire system:
...
Input Enables the user to specify the Host Key.  It identifies the key that
toggles whether the cursor is in the focus of the VM or the Host operating
system windows (see Section 1.8.2, "Capturing and releasing keyboard and
mouse")[2] and which is also used to trigger certain VM actions (see Section
1.8.3, "Typing special characters")
...

Find "Host Key Combination" under Input > Virtual Machine (tab).

I set the shutcut to Right WinKey (triangle) key

Inserting Ctrl-Alt-Del is Host + Del, hence it is nowe Right WinKey + Del,
i.e. Right WinKey + Fn + Del (far upper right key) on the HHK2 keyboard.

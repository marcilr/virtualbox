Save State from command line interface


From the VBoxManage[1] manual:

VBoxManage controlvm <vm> savestate will save the current state
of the VM to disk and then stop the VM.  (This is equivalent to
selecting the "Close" item in the "Machine" menu of the GUI or
pressing the window's close button, and then selecting "Save the
machine state" in the dialog.)

Then you can start again using VBoxManage startvm "Windows XP"
(assuming your VM is named "Windows XP" of course).

You should find the VBoxManage.exe somewhere in your VirtualBox
installation folder. Of course you can add it to your PATH[2] to
have easier access.

Sharing debian's root to windows 10 enterprise.


NOTE: To bring up the menu in virtualbox press Host + c,
      which is right ctrl + c on Debian 9.8 Stretch machine


1. Create debain fold on windows 10 enterprise Desktop:
   C:\Users\remarcil\Desktop\debian

2. Open VirtualBox and configure root share
   right-click machine 
   click Settings...
   click Shared Folders on right

   Under Shared folders verify:
     Name:         debian
     Folder Path:  C:\Users\remarcil\Desktop\debian
     <unchecked>   Read-only
     checked       Auto-mount
     Moount point: /
     checked       Make Permanent

   click OK

3. In machine share root:
   # mount -t vboxsf debian /
   /sbin/mount.vboxsf: Could not open mount table for update.: No such file or directory
   #

4. Install virtualbox guest additions
   i.   Update debian
        # aptitude update
        # aptitude upgrade

   ii. Install packages for building kernel modules:
        # aptitude install build-essential module-assistant

   iii. Prepare system for building modules using
        m-a (module-assistant - manage kernel modules packages)
        # m-a prepare

   iv.  Insert Guest Additions to virtualbox
        click Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image...

        Get error:
          VirtualBox - Error
          Unable to insert the virtual optical disk
          C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\vBoxGuestAdditions.iso
          into the machine Debian 9.8 (Stretch).

        click OK

        Looks like virtualbox wants the vBoxGuestAdditions.iso (82MB)
        at specific location.  Despite VBox_GAs_6.0.4 on debian
        desktop.

        Downloaded latest stable iso:
        $ wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.4/VBoxGuestAdditions_6.0.4.iso

        Movied iso to windows 10 under:
          C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\ 

        With vBoxGuestAdditions.iso downloaded:
          click Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image...

        Still get unable to load optical disk error.

   iv.  No luck in with prior virtualbox Insert Guest Additions CD Image...
        Opted for the VBox_GAs_6.04 iso on desktop.

        double-click VBox_GAs_6.04 (assume latest stable virtualbox
        guest additions v6.04 as of March 22, 2019)

        This mounts /dev/sr0 on /media/cdrom0

   v. On iso run VBoxLinuxAdditions.run:
      # sh /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
      Verifying archive integrity... All good.
      Uncompressing VirtualBox 6.0.4 Guest Additions for Linux........

To share a folder to VirtualBox running linux:

1. Create the directory to share under debian or whatever the host is runnning
VirtualBox.  On the GCI Network Services, OSS box this was /media/covellite.

2. Under Virtualbox (running v4.3.32 r103443)
click Devices > Shared Folders Settings... > Shared Folders

3. Under Shared Folders
click folder with plus symbol to create share

4. At Add Share popup enter folder path specified when created on the host
in step 1 and folder name used to reference the share when mounting in the
vm

Add Share
Folder path: /media/covellite
Folder name: covellite
  Read-only
  Auto-mount
x Make Permanent

click OK

5. The Shared Folder can now be accessed by mounting it via the vm command
line.  The 1st argument is the folder name configured in the prior step.
The 2nd argument is the vm directory to mount the share to.

$ sudo mkdir /media/covellite
$ sudo mount -t vboxsf covellite /media/covellite

NOTE: For the mount point used /media/covellite which is symmetric to the
      directory being mounted on the host.

6. Update fstab to mount /media/covellite in vm on boot:

# <Device> <Mount Point>      <Type>   <Options>           <Dump> <Pass>
covellite  /media/covellite   vboxsf   uid=1000,gid=1000   0      0

Yeh Hah, reboot and check out your new /media/covellite share!

Guest Additions CD image for creating a
shared folder between Debian 9.8 amd64 and
windows 10 enterprise using VirtualBox.

=============================
Latest notes on configuration of share folder between
windows 10 and linux.

The trick to installation of the share folder is the 

In virtualbox
  click Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image...

VBox_GAs_5.2.26 (on desktop)
  right-click > Mount Volume

  Mounts /dev/sr0 on /media/cdrom0 which has:
    /media/cdrom0/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run 

  This installs makes the vboxsf filetype available in fstab
  to mount the VirtualBox share to /media/share.

  Think this was installed byvirtualbox's
    Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image...

Have VirtualBox/ folder on windows desktop that is shared
with debian's /media/share/ directory.

Linux:      Debian 9.7 Stretch amd64
Windows:    Windows 10 Enterprise v1803, os build 17134.523
            installed on 12/12/2018

VirtualBox: VirtualBox-5.2.26-128414-Win.exe (109MB)
  Updated windows 10 from virtualBox v5.2.22 r126460 (Qt5.6.2) to
  latest VirtualBox 5.2.6 r128414 (Qt5.6.2) on Thu Feb 7, 2019
  https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.26/VirtualBox-5.2.26-128414-Win.exe

fstab:
  # VirtualBox share with Windows 10 Enterprise host
  VirtualBox   /media/share     vboxsf  uid=1000,gid=1000          0       0


VirtualBox 5.2.26 r128414 (Qt5.6.2)

  create new shared folder with:
    Folder path:   C:\Users\remarcil\Desktop\VirtualBox

============================
1. Create the directory to share under debian or whatever the host is runnning
VirtualBox.  In this case Windows 10 Enterprise workstation at
State of Alaska DNR.  Created C:\Users\remarcil\Desktop\VirtualBox

2. Under Virtualbox (running v5.2.22 r126460 (Qt5.6.2))
click Devices > Shared Folders Settings... > Shared Folders

3. Under Shared Folders
click folder with plus symbol to create share

4. At Add Share popup enter folder path specified when created on the host
in step 1 and folder name used to reference the share when mounting in the
vm

Add Share
Folder path: C:\Users\remarcil\Desktop\VirtualBox
Folder name: VirtualBox
  Read-only
  Auto-mount
x Make Permanent

click OK

5. The Shared Folder can now be accessed by mounting it via the vm command
line.  The 1st argument is the folder name configured in the prior step.
The 2nd argument is the vm directory to mount the share to.

# sudo mkdir /media/share
# sudo mount -t vboxsf VirtualBox /media/share
# chown remarcil:remarcil /media/share

NOTE: For the mount point used /media/share which is symmetric to the
      directory being mounted on the host.

6. Update fstab to mount /media/share in vm on boot:

# <Device> <Mount Point>      <Type>   <Options>           <Dump> <Pass>
VirtualBox  /media/share   vboxsf   uid=1000,gid=1000   0      0

Yeh Hah, reboot and check out your new /media/share!

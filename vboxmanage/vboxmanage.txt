VBoxManage


VBoxManage is the command-line interface to VirtualBox.  With it, you can
completely control VirtualBox from the command line of your host operating
system.  VBoxManage supports all the features that the graphical user
interface gives you access to, but it supports a lot more than that.  It
exposes really all the features of the virtualization engine, even those that
cannot (yet) be accessed from the GUI.

There are two main things to keep in mind when using VBoxManage

o First,VBoxManage must always be used with a specific "subcommand",
such as "list vms" or "createvm" or "startvm".

o Second, most of these subcommands require that you specify a
particular virtual machine after the subcommand. There are two
ways you can do this:

You can specify the VM name, as it is shown in the VirtualBox GUI.
Note that if that name contains spaces, then you must enclose the
entire name in double quotes (as it is always required with
command line arguments that contain spaces).

"As briefly mentioned in chapter 1.13, Alternative front-ends,
page 28, VBoxManage is the command-line interface to VirtualBox.
With it, you can completely control VirtualBox from the command
line of your host operating system. VBoxManage supports all the
features that the graphical user interface gives you access to,
but it supports a lot more than that.  It exposes really all the

Definately looks like vboxmanage could be used to generate a
virtual machine via the command line for use with windows.

Headless virtual machine


To start a virtualbox headless with VBoxManage:
  
  $ VBoxManage startvm "VM name" --type headless

Example:

  $ vboxmanage startvm "rmarcil1" --type headless
  Waiting for VM "rmarcil1" to power on...
  VBoxManage: error: Failed to load unit 'vga' (VERR_SSM_LOADED_TOO_MUCH)
  VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component \
  Console, interface IConsole
  $

  The vm needs to be shutdown normally via the Oracle VM Virtual Manager in
  order for this to work:

  covellite:~$ vboxmanage startvm "rmarcil1" --type headless
  Waiting for VM "rmarcil1" to power on...
  VM "rmarcil1" has been successfully started.
  $

  covellite:~$ rdesktop -u rmarcil  -p <pass> -d gci -xl -C  -g 1920x938 192.168.92.52

7.1.2. VBoxHeadless, the remote desktop server
==============================================
While any VM started from the VirtualBox Manager is capable of running virtual
machines remotely, it is not convenient to have to run the full-fledged GUI if
you never want to have VMs displayed locally in the first place.  In
particular, if you are running server hardware whose only purpose is to host
VMs, and all your VMs are supposed to run remotely over VRDP, then it is
pointless to have a graphical user interface on the server at all --
especially since, on a Linux or Solaris host, the VirtualBox manager comes
with dependencies on the Qt and SDL libraries.  This is inconvenient if you
would rather not have the X Window system on your server at all.

VirtualBox therefore comes with yet another front-end called VBoxHeadless,
which produces no visible output on the host at all, but instead only delivers
VRDP data.  This front-end has no dependencies on the X Window system on Linux
and Solaris hosts.[34]

To start a virtual machine with VBoxHeadless, you have three options:

o You can use

  VBoxManage startvm "VM name" --type headless

  The extra --type option causes VirtualBox to use VBoxHeadless as the
  front-end to the internal virtualization engine instead of the Qt front-end.

o One alternative is to use VBoxHeadless directly, as follows:

  VBoxHeadless --startvm <uuid|name>

  This way of starting the VM helps troubleshooting problems reported by
  VBoxManage startvm ... because you can see sometimes more detailed error
  messages, especially for early failures before the VM execution is started.
  In normal situations VBoxManage startvm is preferred since it runs the VM
  directly as a background process which has to be done explicitly when
  directly starting VBoxHeadless.

o The other alternative is to start VBoxHeadless from the VirtualBox Manager
  GUI, by holding the Shift key when starting a virtual machine.

Note that when you use VBoxHeadless to start a VM, since the headless server
has no other means of output, the VRDP server will always be enabled,
regardless of whether you had enabled the VRDP server in the VM's settings.
If this is undesirable (for example because you want to access the VM via ssh
only), start the VM like this:

  VBoxHeadless --startvm <uuid|name> --vrde off

To have the VRDP server enabled depending on the VM configuration, as the
other front-ends would, use this:

  VBoxHeadless --startvm <uuid|name> --vrde config

If you start the VM with VBoxManage startvm ... then the configuration
settings of the VM are always used.

7.1.3. Step by step: creating a virtual machine on a headless server
====================================================================
The following instructions may give you an idea how to create a virtual
machine on a headless server over a network connection.  We will create a
virtual machine, establish an RDP connection and install a guest operating
system -- all without having to touch the headless server.  All you need is
the following:

1. VirtualBox on a server machine with a supported host operating system.  The
   VirtualBox extension pack for the VRDP server must be installed (see the
   previous section). For the following example, we will assume a Linux server.

2. An ISO file accessible from the server, containing the installation data
   for the guest operating system to install (we will assume Windows XP in the
   following example).

3. A terminal connection to that host through which you can access a command
   line (e.g. via ssh).

4. An RDP viewer on the remote client; see Section 7.1.1, "Common third-party
   RDP viewers"[1] above for examples.

Note again that on the server machine, since we will only use the headless
server, neither Qt nor SDL nor the X Window system will be needed.

1. On the headless server, create a new virtual machine:

   VBoxManage createvm --name "Windows XP" --ostype WindowsXP --register

   Note that if you do not specify --register, you will have to manually use
   the registervm command later.

   Note further that you do not need to specify --ostype, but doing so selects
   some sane default values for certain VM parameters, for example the RAM
   size and the type of the virtual network device. To get a complete list of
   supported operating systems you can use

   VBoxManage list ostypes

2. Make sure the settings for this VM are appropriate for the guest operating
   system that we will install. For example:

   VBoxManage modifyvm "Windows XP" --memory 256 --acpi on --boot1 dvd \
   --nic1 nat

3. Create a virtual hard disk for the VM (in this case, 10GB in size):

   VBoxManage createhd --filename "WinXP.vdi" --size 10000

4. Add an IDE Controller to the new VM:

   VBoxManage storagectl "Windows XP" --name "IDE Controller"
       --add ide --controller PIIX4

5. Set the VDI file created above as the first virtual hard disk of the new VM:

   VBoxManage storageattach "Windows XP" --storagectl "IDE Controller"
       --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium "WinXP.vdi"

6. Attach the ISO file that contains the operating system installation that
   you want to install later to the virtual machine, so the machine can boot
   from it:

   VBoxManage storageattach "Windows XP" --storagectl "IDE Controller"
       --port 0 --device 1 --type dvddrive --medium /full/path/to/iso.iso

7. Start the virtual machine using VBoxHeadless:

   VBoxHeadless --startvm "Windows XP"

   If everything worked, you should see a copyright notice.  If, instead, you
   are returned to the command line, then something went wrong.

8. On the client machine, fire up the RDP viewer and try to connect to the
   server (see Section 7.1.1, "Common third-party RDP viewers"[2] above for
   how to use various common RDP viewers).

   You should now be seeing the installation routine of your guest operating
   system remotely in the RDP viewer.

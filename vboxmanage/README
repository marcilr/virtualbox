vboxmanage.txt
  VBoxManage is the command-line interface to VirtualBox.  With it, you can
  completely control VirtualBox from the command line of your host operating
  system.  VBoxManage supports all the features that the graphical user
  interface gives you access to, but it supports a lot more than that.  It
  exposes really all the features of the virtualization engine, even those that
  cannot (yet) be accessed from the GUI.

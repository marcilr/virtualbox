Bridge virtual network cards to host interface in virtual machine using vboxmanage.
Each vm has eight virtual network cards NIC1 to NIC8 that can be bridged to physical
host interfaces.

ing a vm from one of the eight VirtualBox virtual network cards to host interface can be 
accomplished with vboxmanager.

1. Configure virtual nic 1 to 8 for bridged mode.

1. Enable bridged network for virtual network card eth0:
$ vboxmanage modifyvm ajoite-non-domain --nic1 bridged

NOTE: Virtual network card eth0 binds to nic1 *not* nic0.

2. Bind virtual network card eth0 to host interface  eth6:
$ vboxmanage modifyvm ajoite-non-domain --bridgeadapter1 eth6

That will do it!


--nic<1-N> none|null|nat|bridged|intnet|hostonly|generic : With this, you can set, for each of the VM's
  virtual network cards, what type of networking should be available.  They can be not present (none), not
  connected to the host (null), use network address translation (nat), bridged networking (bridged) or
  communicate with other virtual machines using internal networking (intnet), host-only networking
  (hostonly), or access rarely used sub-modes (generic).  These options correspond to the modes which are
  described in detail in the section called "Introduction to networking modes".[1]

--bridgeadapter<1-N> none|<devicename>: If bridged networking has been enabled for a virtual network card 
  (see the --nic option above; otherwise this setting has no effect), use this option to specify which host
  interface the given virtual network interface will use. For details, please see the section called
  "Bridged networking".[2]

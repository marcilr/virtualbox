8.20 VBoxManage showhdinfo
==========================
This command shows information about a virtual hard disk image, notably its size, its size on
disk, its type and the virtual machines which use it.

Note: For compatibility with earlier versions of VirtualBox, the "showvdiinfo" 
      command is also supported and mapped internally to the "showhdinfo" command.

The disk image must be specified either by its UUID (if the medium is registered) or by its
filename. Registered images can be listed by VBoxManage list hdds (see chapter 8.3, VBox-
Manage list, page 111 for more information). A filename must be specified as valid path, either
as an absolute path or as a relative path starting from the current directory.

List all virtual machines:
  $ vboxmanage list vms

List running virtual machines:
  $ vboxmanage list runningvms

List machine state:
  $ vboxmanage list vms -l | grep -e ^Name: -e ^State | sed s/\ \ //g

List machine state - a bit prettier:
  $ vboxmanage list vms -l | grep -e ^Name: -e ^State  | \
  sed "s/Name:[ ]*\(.*\)/\1 \//;s/State:[\ ]*//" | paste -d " " - -

$ vboxmanage list vms
"ajoite-non-domain" {a80f04fc-4ec5-49f6-8b08-607f000b13a7}

VBoxManage list
===============
The list command gives relevant information about your system and information about VirtualBox's
current settings.

The following subcommands are available with VBoxManage list:

o vms lists all virtual machines currently registered with VirtualBox.  By default this displays a
  compact list with each VM's name and UUID; if you also specify --long or -l, this will be a
  detailed list as with the showvminfo command (see below).

o runningvms lists all currently running virtual machines by their unique identifiers (UUIDs) in
  the same format as with vms.

o ostypes lists all guest operating systems presently known to VirtualBox, along with the
  identifiers used to refer to them with the modifyvm command.

o hostdvds, hostfloppies, respectively, list DVD, floppy, bridged networking and host-only
  networking interfaces on the host, along with the name used to access them from within
  VirtualBox.

o bridgedifs, hostonlyifs and dhcpservers, respectively, list bridged network interfaces,
  host-only network interfaces and DHCP servers currently available on the host.  Please see
  Chapter 6, Virtual networking[1] for details on these.

o hostinfo displays information about the host system, such as CPUs, memory size and operating
  system version.

o hostcpuids dumps the CPUID parameters for the host CPUs. This can be used for a more fine
  grained analyis of the host's virtualization capabilities.

o hddbackends lists all known virtual disk back-ends of VirtualBox.  For each such format (such as
  VDI, VMDK or RAW), this lists the back-end's capabilities and configuration.

o hdds, dvds and floppies all give you information about virtual disk images currently in use by
  VirtualBox, including all their settings, the unique identifiers (UUIDs) associated with them by
  VirtualBox and all files associated with them.  This is the command-line equivalent of the
  Virtual Media Manager; see the section called "The Virtual Media Manager".[2]        

o usbhost supplies information about USB devices attached to the host, notably information useful
  for constructing USB filters and whether they are currently in use by the host.

o usbfilters lists all global USB filters registered with VirtualBox -- that is, filters for
  devices which are accessible to all virtual machines -- and displays the filter parameters.

o systemproperties displays some global VirtualBox settings, such as minimum and maximum guest
  RAM and virtual hard disk size, folder settings and the current authentication library in use.

o extpacks displays all VirtualBox extension packs currently installed; see the section called
  "Installing VirtualBox and extension packs"[3] and the section called "VBoxManage extpack"[4]
  for more information.

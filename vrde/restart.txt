Windows command line restart


The RDP session to the win 7 pro ajoite-non-domain machine does not have restart on
the task bar.

Had to use the command line:

Comand line restart:
  shutdown -r -t 01

Command line shutdown:
  shutdown -s -t 01


Create shortcuts
================
To create command line shortcuts to shutdown or restart.

1. Right click on an empty space on the desktop to open the context menu
2. Select New
3. Select Shortcut with a left-click
4. In the location box type cmd /k plus whatever command you want.

For example, if you want a shortcut to restart, your location box would contain:

cmd /k shutdown -r -t 01

VBoxHeadless


VirtualBox therefore comes with yet another front-end called VBoxHeadless, which produces no
visible output on the host at all, but instead only delivers VRDP data.  This front-end has no
dependencies on the X Window system on Linux and Solaris hosts.[33]

To start a virtual machine with VBoxHeadless, you have two options:

o You can use
    vboxmanage startvm "VM name" --type headless

The extra --type option causes VirtualBox to use VBoxHeadless as the front-end to the internal
virtualization engine instead of the Qt front-end.

o The alternative is to use VBoxHeadless directly, as follows:
    vboxheadless --startvm <uuid|name>   <=== Preferred

i.e. use:
    vboxheadless --startvm ajoite-non-domain &   (no spaces so no quotes needed)

This way of starting the VM is preferred because you can see more detailed error messages,
especially for early failures before the VM execution is started. If you have trouble with
VBoxManage startvm, it can help greatly to start VBoxHeadless directly to diagnose the problem
cause.

Note that when you use VBoxHeadless to start a VM, since the headless server has no other means of
output, the VRDP server will always be enabled, regardless of whether you had enabled the VRDP
server in the VM's settings.  If this is undesirable (for example because you want to access the
VM via ssh only), start the VM like this:
  vboxheadless --startvm <uuid|name> --vrde=off

To have the VRDP server enabled depending on the VM configuration, as the other front-ends would,
use this:

  vboxheadless --startvm <uuid|name> --vrde=config

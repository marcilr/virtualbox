VirtualBox


VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization 
product for enterprise as well as home use.  Not only is VirtualBox 
an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise 
customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely 
available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General 
Public License (GPL) version 2. See "About VirtualBox" for an 
introduction.
--virtualbox.org/


"Oracle VM VirtualBox is an x86 virtualization software package, 
originally created by software company innotek GmbH, purchased by 
Sun Microsystems, and now developed by Oracle Corporation as part 
of its family of virtualization products. It is installed on an 
existing host operating system; within this application, additional 
guest operating systems, each known as a Guest OS, can be loaded 
and run, each with its own virtual environment."

"According to 2010 surveys by LinuxJournal.com [5] and LifeHacker.com [6], 
VirtualBox was the most popular virtualization product with over 50% of 
the vote."

o Check virtualbox installation:

$ dpkg -l | grep virtualbox
ii  virtualbox-6.0   6.0.6-130049~Debian~stretch   amd64   Oracle VM VirtualBox

Looks like the virtualbox 6.0.6 upgrade took.

Very good.

Wed Apr  3 07:16:12 AKDT 2019
=============================
On Debian 9.8 VPN (Stretch) - Oracle VM VirtualBox,
running virtualbox v6.0.4r128413 (Qt 5.6.2) under
Windows 10.

Machine runs well but does periodically hang
for no appearent reason.  Perhaps need to adjust
resources.

The machine only had 1024MB of potential 16384MB
allocated.  Updating to 4096MB to see if this alleviates
virtual memory issues or such.  Need to shutdown vm to
do so.  Seem reasoning.  

Rock n' roll


Thu Jan 10 08:25:55 AST 2019
============================
Trying again with installation of:
  debian-9.2.1-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso

  Goal being to alleviate having to update distro with XFCE.

  Installation failed for the 3rd time.  Got back to install list
  and tried again.  Much faster with 1163 files (didn't check ssh).

  ===> Doing an Advanced manual installation.  Harkens back to old 
       installation days.  Appears to be working.  1166 packages
       being quickly installed.

Per online advice installed the dynamically allocated disk size
from 8GB to 32GB:
  Fail to install software during Debian installation on Virtualbox
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43415270/fail-to-install-software-during-debian-installation-on-virtualbox

Tried again with 32GB and got exact same error.

When attempting to install debian-9.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso to new 
Debian virtual machine under VirtualBox v5.2.22r126460 (Qt5.6.2)
installation fails with:

  Installation step failed
  An installation step failed.  You can try to run the failing item again
  from the menu, or skip it and choose something else.  The failing step is:
  Select and install software



Starting
========
o In GNOME, go to: GNOME menu > Applications > System tools > VirtualBox OSE

This worked under debian squeeze installation.

o From an X terminal:
$ virtualbox
  or
$ VirtualBox

Server - You can start VirtualBox in Headless mode using VBoxHeadless 
like this:
$ VBoxHeadless -startvm "VMName"

VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.12.iso Think this comes in the main virtualbox
binary but I'll be darned if I know how to install from it.

Hence downloaded VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.12.iso:
$ cd ~/VirtualBox\ VMs
$ wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.12/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.12.iso

In VirtualBox Manager:
  click Settings > Storage

Under Controller IDE:
  click VBoxGuestAdditions.iso 
  click cdrom (upper left) > Remove Disk from Virtual Drive
  This will change VBoxGuestAdditions.iso to Empty.

Add new VBoxGuestAdditions:
  click cdrom > Choose Virtual Optical Disk File...
  select ~/VirtualBox\ VMs/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.12.iso
  click OK

  In VirtualBox Manager under Stroage now see:
  Controller IDE:

NOTE: Could not get Devices > Install Guest Additions to work,
      Successfully reused the previous VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.16.iso 

Installed VBoxGuestAdditions.iso
  Look under Devices
  Postby Paul Abrahams > 5. Jun 2008, 18:44

  The guest additions are actually included (invisibly) in the binary package.
  You get at them by choosing Install Guest Additions from the Devices menu.
  You then install them by mounting the Guest Additions iso file, which will
  show up in the list of available images.  As far as I know, the Guest
  Additions aren't available separately and don't need to be. 

  I had the very same question that you did, and I'll bet many others do also.

=============================
Window resizing for rmarcil1 in virtualbox started to work.  Think this is
due to:

Installation of Guest Additions to machine.  In machine window:
  Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image...

"If you have the Guest Additions installed and they support automatic resizing,
the Guest Additions will automatically adjust the screen resolution of the guest
operating system.  For example, if you are running a Windows guest with a
resolution of 1024x768 pixels and you then resize the VM window to make it 100
pixels wider, the Guest Additions will change the Windows display resolution to
1124x768."   <=== Sweet!

From slash vmware thread:

This is why I use VirtualBox... (3)
by RocketRabbit (830691) on Tuesday August 28, @01:59PM (#41152571)

VirtualBox costs a very reasonable $50 if you want to deploy it commercially.  It competes well
with VMware on features and speed, and is user-friendly enough to recommend to small businesses.

VMware is expensive, the licenses are confusing, and overall it's just become a gigantic pain in
the ass.

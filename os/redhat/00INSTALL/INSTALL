   We could not detect partitions of filesystems on this device.

   This could be because the device is blank, unpartitioned,

   not be recovered if you use it in this installation.  We can 
   remove the device from this installation to protect the data.

   "Hardware Clock in UTC Time: If selected, Oracle VM VirtualBox
   will report the system time in UTC format to the guest instead
   of the local (host) time.  This affects how the virtual real-time
   clock (RTC) operates and may be useful for UNIX-like guest OSes,
   which typically expect the hardware clock to be set to UTC."

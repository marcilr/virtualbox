Installed Red Hat 6 to Oracle VM VirtualBox
at SOA OIT DNR.

hostname:    cfusion2016.dnr.state.ak.us
credentials: root/the usual + A#8

ip address:  The initial machine only displays 127.0.0.1
             for ip address.  Not configured for dhcp or nat yet.


Network configuration
=====================
This page : http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html

covers the virtualbox networking quite well.

NAT - Your host will act as a router (firewall) and your guests
  will be on a private subnet.  Use this if you are not running
  servers on the guests.

Bridged - Your guests will get a ip address on the same subnet as
  your host.  Use this if you are running servers on the guest
  and wish to connect from other computers on the LAN.

Host Only - Sort of a hybrid.  As the name implies, with this
  option you can connect to the guest servers from the host only.
  Use this for "private" (host only) servers.  I use this if I
  am running a test web server.

To make a long story short, assuming you have a router, I would
use bridged networking.

  What are the main differences between VirtualBox networking types? [closed]
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/95022/what-are-the-main-differences-between-virtualbox-networking-types

In a nutshell looks like Bridged is the way to go.

In virtualbox 6.0.10 r132072 (Qt5.6.2)

1. With vm Powered Off in virtual box configure networking:

right-click Red Hat 6 Clone - 2010805
select Settings...
click Network on left

With Adapter 1 tab selected:
  checked Enable Network Adapter (default)
    Attached to: Bridged Adapter (updated from NAT)
           Name: Intel(R) Ethernet Connection (2) I219-LM (default)
  Advanced:
    Adapter TYpe:     Intel Pro/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) (default)
    Promiscuous Mode: Deny (default)
    MAC Address:      08002727F812 (default)
    checked Cable Connected (default)

    Port Forwarding (greyed out).

click OK

Looks good.

2. With bridged networking configured start the machine:

right-click Red Hat 6 Clone - 20190805
select Start > Normal Start

3. Login to booted Red Hat 6 Clone:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.10 (Santiago)
Kernel 2.6.32-754.e16.x86_64 on an x86_64

cfusion2016 login: root
Password:          the usual + A#8
Last login: Mon Aug  5 14:12;36 on tty1
[root@cfusion2016 ~]#

4. Configured openssh to start and run at boot:

start ssh daemon:
# service sshd start

stop ssh daemon (here for completeness):
# service sshd stop

Run sshd daemon automatically at boot time:

# chkconfig sshd on

5. Restart and verify sshd starts up automatically:

# shutdown -r now
...
cfusion2016 login: root
Password:          the usual + A#8
Last login: Mon Aug  5 14:12;36 on tty1
#

# ps aux | grep [s]shd
root    1532  0.0  0.0  66288  1176 ?    Ss   14:41   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd
#

sshd is running on restart.

Looks good.
